/**
 * ## Order of events:
 *
 * * **Input phase†:**
 * * Input events are fired (in the order they are received)
 * * **Game phase:**
 * * Minecraft ticks and renders the frame
 * * **Update phase:**
 * * Updates animations
 * * Fires [Update]
 * * **Layout phase:**
 * * Calls [GuiLayer.prepareLayout] and fires [PrepareLayout]
 * * Calls [GuiLayer.layoutChildren] and fires [LayoutChildren] for all dirty layers
 * * **Draw phase:**
 *
 * ## †Input notes:
 * [GLFW input guide](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/input_guide.html)
 *
 * Do note that there may be multiple events of a single type fired during the same frame, since events continue to be
 * queued between frames. For example, this is a possible sequence of events to receive in a single frame:
 * * `MouseMoved(pos=(100, 100))`
 * * `MouseDown(pos=(100, 100), button=0)`
 * * `MouseUp(pos=(100, 100), button=0)`
 * * `MouseMoved(pos=(120, 120))`
 * * `MouseDown(pos=(120, 120), button=0)`
 * * `MouseUp(pos=(120, 120), button=0)`
 *
 * Interestingly, the input phase is actually fired at the _end_ of the frame. I've placed it at the start in this list
 * because to an extent the end of one frame is the start of the next, and thinking of it as the start of the frame is
 * easier to reason about. However, in a few situations this distinction may be an important thing to keep in mind.
